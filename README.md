#Web-Socket Spring Boot ByteArray Example

This project is simple example of how create Spring boot web-socket server which get and send byte[]

## How to use

If You want to see how it works just go to ```localhost:8080``` where is html example. If You want to see two camera just duplicate card in browser. If You want two camera but with different videos, don't forget to change url address in js file (now is set to localhost, just find brokerUrl propertie). 

I tried to add comment to all important methods in spring project. This is not JS/HTML example, so I didn't pay much attention about code in this 2 files.

## Test

There is simple integration test but without CI/CD in GH (Circle-ci has a problem with this java file)
